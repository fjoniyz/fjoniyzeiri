    <h2><b>Education</b></h2>
    <p><em>Technical University of Berlin - B.Sc. Computer Science (since October 2020)</em></p>
    <hr style="width: 150px; margin-left: 0; background-color: black;"/>
    <p style="margin-right:50px">My main focus during my studies lies in software engineering, cloud computing and distributed systems. After doing the basic 
        courses of my degree, I started focusing more on courses that would help me better understand the challenges 
        that I would face in my day-to-day work. For this reason I chose to also do 2 practical internships at the university
        and other courses related to my interests. The end of my B.Sc. should be around April of 2024.

    <h2><b>Work experience</b></h2>
    <p><em>SAP (since November 2021)</em></p>
    <hr style="width: 150px; margin-left: 0; background-color: black;"/>
    <p style="margin-right:50px"> Part of the Master Data Integration team based in Potsdam, Germany. As a working student I get different tasks where I get the chance
        to learn different technologies and techniques when it comes to software engineering and working with cloud based solutions. Most of the time I have worked
        with Java, ReasonML and Kafka. This has helped me understand technologies like Kafka much better and also I have had the opportunity to improve my skills in functional programming by using ReasonML.
